## Creating an HTML file and a linked JavaScript file

Create an HTML file and create a separate JavaScript file. Then, connect to the JavaScript file from the HTML file.

1. In the JavaScript file, output your name into the console and add a multiple-line comment to your code.
2. Try commenting out the console message in your JavaScript file so that nothing shows in the console.
