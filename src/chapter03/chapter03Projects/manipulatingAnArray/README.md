# Manipulating an Array

Take the following array:

```js
const theList = ['Laurence', 'Svekis', true, 35, null, undefined, 
{test: 'one', score: 55}, ['one', 'two']];
```

Manipulate your array using various methods, such as `pop()`, `push()`, `shift()`, and `unshift()`, and transform it into the following:

```js
  ["FIRST", "Svekis", "MIDDLE", "hello World", "LAST"]
```

You can take the following steps, or adopt your own approach:

- Remove the first item and the last item.
- Add FIRST to the start of the array.
- Assign hello World to the fourth item value.
- Assign MIDDLE to the third index value.
- Add LAST to the last position in the array.
- Output it to the console.
