# Practice Exercise 2.3

Write some code to calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle using the Pythagorean theorem when given the values of the other two sides. The theorem specifies that the relation between the sides of a right-angled triangle is a^2+b^2=c^2.

You can use `prompt()` to get the value for a and b. Write code to get the value from the user for a and b. Then square the values of both a and b before adding them together and finding the square root. Print your answer to the console.
